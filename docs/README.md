**Dear sir/madam
It is my pleasure to introduce myself as Nima, My nickname is KhodeNima, I am a determined young individual of fourteen years old with a strong passion for cybersecurity; I plan to pursue higher education in the universities abroad, in order to serve my homeland the best way possible. I aim to realize my ambitions through steadfast dedication and determination, ambitions which
commenced to manifest themselves while I was younger.**


**In the bygone times, I have had hight subsequent passion when it came to computers, especially in the case of
delegating intensive chunks of the time researching the World Wide Web, which clutched multifarious impacts in my path of
self-learning English.**


**The alloy of computer engineering passion and research, was followed by interest in soft skills over my following
years of education, which anointed me to enjoy giving speeches and discovering novel methodologies in order to enhance existing fellowships.**
**Despite the fact that I frankly find developing interactions an effortless process, in the absence of knowledgeable associates,
I prefer to do many tasks separately, especially the ones which I enjoy the most, including Version Control Ma

nagement jobs and writing basic 
project documentations.**


**Unfortunately, there are numerous significant operations which I dislike in which I prefer mentorship and cooperation,
in order to cite a slight segmentation, I can relate to producing charming Graphical User Interfaces ( GUI ), 
Graphics editing ( pictures, videos ) and data management through microsoft softwares, with the indication that
my periodic attachment and joy in working with Text User Interface ( TUI ) is the cause of my hassle with Graphics.**


**In the field of academics, I would prefer to consider classical education a secondary element to self-learning, a manner which**
**I actively support; Albeit, I am honored to be of the students of the Iran NODET ( National Organization for Development of Exceptional Talents )***
**school, where I steadily attempt to join and triumpth manifold competitions, especially in the branches of English speaking,** 
**Computer engineering and religion, which are entierly mentioned in the following list:**
- ***Khawrizmi software engineering competition*** -> | In progress...
- ***Omid-e-Farda game development competitin*** -> | **City zone: Rank 1** | **Province zone: Rank 2**.
- ***Danaii-Tavanaii book reading competition*** -> | **City zone: Rank 1** | **Province zone: Rank 2**.
- ***Religious speech and debate competition*** ->  | **City zone: Rank 1** | Province zone: In progress...


**The mentioned factors caused me to develop prominent skills which I still employ today as an enthusiastic who is
demanding to cause intensive touch in the industry.**
