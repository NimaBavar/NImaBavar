**Dear sir/madam
It is my pleasure to introduce myself as Nima, My nickname is KhodeNima, I am a determined young individual of fourteen years old with a strong passion for cybersecurity; I plan to pursue higher education in the universities abroad, in order to serve my homeland the best way possible. I aim to realize my ambitions through steadfast dedication and determination, ambitions which
commenced to manifest themselves since I was younger.**

**In the bygone times, I have had hight subsequent passion when it came to computers, especially in the case of
delegating intensive chunks of the time researching the World Wide Web, which clutched multifarious impacts in my path of
self-learning English.**

**The alloy of computer engineering passion and research, was followed by interest in soft skills over my following
years of education, which anointed me to enjoy giving speeches and discovering methodologies in order to enhance existing fellowships.**
**Despite the fact that I frankly find developing interactions an effortless process, in the absence of knowledgeable associates,
I prefer to do many tasks separately.**

**The mentioned factors caused me to develop prominent skills which I still employ today as an enthusiastic who is
demanding to cause intensive touch in the industry.**
